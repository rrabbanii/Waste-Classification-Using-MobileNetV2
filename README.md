# TrashSure ML Classification Model

## Description

Welcome to the TrashSure ML Classification Model repository! This repository contains an efficient machine learning model that has been trained to perform the task of classifying various waste types.

The main goal of this project is to assist in the automated classification of waste items into specific categories. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to contribute to environmental sustainability and waste management efforts.

## Dataset

We used a custom waste classification dataset for training the model. This dataset is available for download from the following link: [Custom Waste Classification Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/5/folders/1A2RNozuokGmhlhXJZ5ta48bd_dMeNf4V). The dataset contains samples from seven different waste classes, allowing our model to effectively classify waste items.

The waste classes in the dataset include:
1. e-Waste
2. Glass
3. Medical
4. Metal
5. Paper
6. Plastic
7. Textiles

## Pre-Requisites

Before using this classification model, please ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Python**: You need to have Python installed, preferably version 3.8 or later.

2. **Python Packages**: The necessary Python packages for running the model are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install these packages using `pip` as shown below.
