Waste Classification Using MobileNetV2 Project

## Description

This repository contains an efficient machine learning model that has been trained to perform the task of classifying various waste types. The main goal of this project is to assist in the automated classification of waste items into specific categories. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the aim is to contribute to environmental sustainability and waste management efforts.

## Dataset

A custom waste classification dataset was used for training the model. This dataset is available for download from the following link: [Custom Waste Classification Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/5/folders/1A2RNozuokGmhlhXJZ5ta48bd_dMeNf4V). The dataset contains samples from seven different waste classes, allowing the model to effectively classify waste items.

The waste classes in the dataset include:
1. e-Waste
2. Glass
3. Medical
4. Metal
5. Paper
6. Plastic
7. Textiles

## Pre-Requisites

Before using this classification model, please ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Python**: You need to have Python installed, preferably version 3.8 or later.

2. **Python Packages**: The necessary Python packages for running the model are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install these packages using `pip` as shown below.

## Installation

To get started with the Classification Model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local device using `git`:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Waste-Classification-Using-MobileNetV2/trashsure-ml-classification-model.git

2. Change your current directory to the repository:

   ```
   cd trashsure-ml-classification-model
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install the required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
